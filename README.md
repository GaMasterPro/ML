# ML

This project is a full-stack, high-performance system that brings together Machine Learning, asynchronous programming, Docker, Kafka, and Flask into one seamless pipeline.

🧠 Machine Learning handles the intelligence — model training, inference, and smart decision-making.

⚡ Asynchronous programming ensures non-blocking performance and insane speed for handling real-time data.

🐳 Docker containers keep everything isolated, clean, and easy to deploy.

🛰️ Kafka acts as the backbone for messaging and streaming — real-time, distributed, and reliable.

🌐 Flask serves as the lightweight API interface to expose ML predictions and insights.

Whether you're streaming sensor data, crunching it with ML models, or serving results via a responsive API, this project is designed to be scalable, modular, and blazing fast.
